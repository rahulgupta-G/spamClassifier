An email spam classifier
<br>
###### This is a simple project on classifying emails as spam or non-spam using Naive Bayes algorithm
<br>

There are various techniques for spam filtering of messages or emails. Here are few that are most commonly used.

<br>

**(a)** Signature matching

**(b)** Heuristics

**(c)** DNS Blacklisting

**(d)** Bayesian Filtering

**(e)** Challenge / Response method

<br>

Here we are using Bayesian Filtering Method

<br>

**Steps to get the project up and running**

<br>

**1.** Install the required dependencies

**2.** Choose a data set to train you model with and run the train.py file. 

**3.** The train.py will start writing data to a new .hdf5 file which is the file for storing our model.

**4.** After creating the model run Input_dialog_box.py file
